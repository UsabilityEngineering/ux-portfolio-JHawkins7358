# UX Portfolio

Hello! My name is Jonathan Hawkins and I am a Computer Science major. I'm hoping to take my knowledge here and apply it to game design or something else that strikes my fancy. I am an avid gamer and I am very fascinated by good game design and I'm hoping to use the knowledge I develop here to aid in good game design. Outside of that, I find the study of UX to be extremely fascinating since it applies to everything we interact with in daily life.
