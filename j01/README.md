# Adjusting the A/C in 2023

My partner’s car is a 2022 Subaru Outback. As one would expect from a vehicle, the ability to control the climate inside is vital. For a good amount of time, I have been used to a more analog style of temperature control in a car. The image below is what I have in my own vehicle (a 2015 Ford Fiesta) and it seems to be pretty simple:

As you can see, the center dial controls which direction the air is blowing (at your face, at your feet, etc.), the left dial controls the force of the air being blown out, and the right dial controls the temperature of the air. Pretty straightforward I would say.

Nowadays, we have moved away from dials and buttons and replaced them with a giant touch screen. Before we get into the ways you can control the climate of your vehicle, I would like to note something that changes when you move from analog to digital. Whenever you turn the knobs on the Focus’ interface there is a tactile sensation, a clicking. Personally, I find myself adjusting the A/C in my car most often when I am driving, a time when I don’t have the ability to be looking at the center console of my car to figure out what I am doing. Having the clicks indicate that I have turned up or down the A/C without having to divert my attention. 
However, the digital touch pad does not have any tactile sensations indicating that we have achieved our goal. This ties into the idea of **user feedback**: the idea that whenever an action is performed on a device there is some sort of feedback to indicate to the user they did something (be it positive or negative). The touchpad does make a noise whenever you tap it. The only problem with it is it’s the same noise you hear no matter what you are tapping, even if you don't tap on a button on screen. While you get still get feedback, it isn’t very helpful on it's own. As such, I wouldn’t consider this a **safe** design as it requires you to physically look at the screen to know what you’re doing.
Now, let’s look at the A/C. Here is the screen you are presented the moment you start the car:

As you can see on the bottom of the screen, there are numbers indicating what the current temperature is for either side of the car. Let’s say it’s a rainy day and you want to turn up the heat, in the car. If you wanted to increase the temperature, you could just hit the red arrow button pointing up to the left of the screen. This will increase the temperature for sure. This system **matches what we expect in the real world**, an important concept in usability engineering that states that well-designed systems help users by making functionality match what we see in the real world. This makes sense as red is associated with heat and since heat is a higher temperature. Simple enough.
Now, let’s say you want the air to just hit your feet and you want the defroster on. You would have to tap the picture of the person in the seated position with arrows pointed at them in two different spots. This opens a new a completely new window that looks as follows:

Here I am presented with a multitude of options: Do you want the A/C to be max? Where do you want the air? How fast do you want the air? Oh, and here is a diagram of where the air is going. I find this Climate Control window to be too cluttered. This goes against the idea of **minimalism in design**. The idea here is fewer functions is better or, when there are many different functions, doing your best to keep the functions ordered, labeled clearly, and try to keep them separate and easy to see. Everything is clearly labeled, sure, but there are too many buttons to take in while piloting a vehicle. 
Above all else, I would say that this design lacks **safety**. While the screen is huge, buttons are huge, and most are clearly labeled, a lot of it requires you to either already know where each button is or require you to actually look at the screen. Sure, this can be circumvented by just adjusting your temperature before you disengage that parking brake but that doesn’t cover everyone who uses this interface. Me personally? I’m generally in a hurry so adjusting the temp happens while I am driving. While it isn’t as sleek or hip or cool, using a knob you have to turn rather than a screen you have to learn makes the system much safer. I’m not a fan of the huge screen in cars. If they have to be the future design, it would be more usable to keep the A/C something you can adjust without your eyes.
